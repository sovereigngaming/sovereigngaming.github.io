css classes affecting the order (flexbox order) of the selected images

The filters are static non responsive position absolute

The number of gamese is counted through a For in loop

The games are store in an Object of arrays called "Category"
The value in each key is an array of arrays that contain Title/Description/StarNumber of each game

The game show is being assigned through creating a div for each game in the selected property and appending it
The removal of these divs is done after the user clicks another property so that new one are assigned
The spacing and alignments of these divs is done through Flex Box

Most Popular is randomly generated and only shows games 4 stars and above no duplicates
